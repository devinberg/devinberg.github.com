Today was the first meeting with my mentor for the Twitter in the Classroom SoTL project for the Teaching Champions program. My mentor is Todd Zimmerman who does a lot of SoTL based work through his research into [Learning Objective Based Assessment](http://talkingphysics.wordpress.com/).

The meeting served primarily as an introduction to what the intentions are behind my project. However, we did discuss a few items that I wanted to note down.

+ There was agreement that I have a need for better use of instrumentation to measure "soft" data. Likely using a survey which would be the most common method for generating this data. Todd will help me with my first attempts at crafting a survey to measure against the intended outcomes. I've already [started crafting these outcomes](|filename|/blog/Ideas/intro-sotl-project.md). However, these outcomes likely still need some work.
+ Regarding the need to better express my project goals, the idea came up of wanting "inside class" and "outside class" to not be two discreet things with regards to where engineering theory exists. I want students to see the things I talk about in class outside and be able to connect their normal outside experiences with the things that we talk about in class. Not yet sure how to measure this. INSIDE $ \Leftrightarrow $ OUTSIDE

##Next Steps
My goal over the next few weeks is going to be to draft a [Likert scale](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likert_scale) style survey with Todd's help. Probably 5 to 15 questions. Plan to meet again towards the end of March.
