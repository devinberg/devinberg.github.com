Summary: The initial idea and sketches for a static equilibrium demonstrator for my statics class.

I would like to provide a more hands on way for students to explore static equilibrium and test the theory. The idea I have is to provide a simple frame structure that students can use to hang a mass from and then evaluate the force vectors. Rubberbands? Calibration?
