# What is this?
This collection of page headquartered at [notebook.devinberg.com](http://notebook.devinberg.com) is intended to serve as an [open engineering notebook](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_notebook_science). Basically what this means is that research outputs are posted in more or less real time as they are generated. This could include data, figures, drawing, notes, links to resources, how-to's, etc. For me it will likely be more weighted towards drawings, figures, and some data since my field is engineering (specifically engineering design). There are of course instances where this will not be possible such as work that involves information about my students or other confidential information for which I am not the only stakeholder.

# How does this website run?
This site is powered by the blogging platform [Pelican](http://getpelican.com). The content is written in Markdown from which static HTML files are generated by Pelican. Both the source code and the output is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/devinberg/devinberg.github.com) and [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/), respectively, and then mirrored on this site. To put this together, I followed the well written tutorial found [here](http://magically.us/2013-02-03/creating-a-pelican-powered-site-on-github-pages.html). This provides both ease of updating the content as well as a time stamp and revision tracking for all things posted here.

I'm sure that the ways that I use this notebook will evolve over time but for now I intend to organize it using tags to collect various posts. This post is tagged [informational](http://notebook.devinberg.com/tag/informational.html). I will generate a unique tag for each project that makes its way here such that the posts for an individual project can be grouped together. I'm not sure yet if I will use categorization but if I do it will likely involve organizing types of posts (ideas, designs, resources, etc.).
