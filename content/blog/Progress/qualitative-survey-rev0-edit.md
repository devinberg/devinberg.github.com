Summary: An edit of a qualitative survey.


Had another meeting with my NTLC Teaching Champions program mentor. At the [last meeting](|filename|/blog/Progress/mentor-meeting-sotl.md) it was decided that my next step would be to draft a qualitative survey. I [did that](|filename|/blog/Progress/qualitative-survey-rev0.md) and thus we used this meeting to review the survey and make some edits to make it better. The resulting marked up file is included below.
