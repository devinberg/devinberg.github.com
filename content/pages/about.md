### About me

I am an Assistant Professor in the [Engineering & Technology Department](http://www.uwstout.edu/et) at the [University of Wisconsin - Stout](http://www.uwstout.edu). I also act as the Program Director for the BS Manufacturing Engineeing degree program here at UW-Stout. This means that I am responsible the day-to-day operations of the program, recruiting, assessment, and answering student questions. I primarily teach in the area of mechanics but also teach capstone courses and various other things. My research interests are in the fields of engineering education, bio-inspired design, and medical devices.

### This site

This collection of pages headquartered at [notebook.devinberg.com](http://notebook.devinberg.com) is intended to serve as an [open engineering notebook](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_notebook_science). Basically what this means is that research outputs are posted in more or less real time as they are generated. This could include data, figures, drawing, notes, links to resources, how-to's, etc. For me it will likely be more weighted towards drawings, figures, and some data since my field is engineering (specifically engineering design). There are of course instances where this will not be possible such as work that involves information about my students or other confidential information for which I am not the only stakeholder. I will also use this space for general notetaking that may not be of interest to anyone besides myself.

This site is powered by the blogging platform [Pelican](http://getpelican.com). The content is written in Markdown from which static HTML files are generated by Pelican. Both the source code and the output is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/devinberg/devinberg.github.com) and [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/), respectively, and then mirrored on this site. To put this together, I followed the well written tutorial found [here](http://magically.us/2013-02-03/creating-a-pelican-powered-site-on-github-pages.html). This provides both ease of updating the content as well as a time stamp and revision tracking for all things posted here.
