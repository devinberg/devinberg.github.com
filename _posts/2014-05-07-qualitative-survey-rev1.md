At my last mentor meeting we worked on making [comments on my first draft of the qualitative survey]({% post_url 2014-04-01-qualitative-survey-rev0-edit %}). I finally got around to make some revisions to the survey based on those comments. The current version is below.

###The Survey Draft
1. How would you rate your ability to identify statics and dynamics principles in your surroundings?

    a. I am not sure how the statics and dynamics principles discussed in this class relate to real life.
	
    b. I can understand the application of statics and dynamics to a real life example when shown an example.
	
    c. I can identify the statics and dynamics principles discussed in this class when I see them.
	
    d. I can analyze the statics and dynamics principles relevant to a situation that I observe.


2. How prepared are you to discuss engineering mechanics with others?

    a. I do not think that I could carry on a conversation about engineering mechanics with others.

    b. I could describe simple engineering mechanics ideas with someone but not in detail.

    c. I could discuss engineering mechanics in a thoughtful manner even on topics that are new to me.

    d. I seek out conversations about engineering mechanics because I want more people to understand how the world around them works.

3. How do you see yourself fitting within the greater engineering community?

    a. I am not sure how I fit into the greater engineering community.

    b. I see myself as an engineer who maintains a separation between my engineering job and personal life.

    c. I see myself as an engineer who actively promotes greater engineering knowledge in the world.

    d. I see myself as an engineer who does outreach in my community and encourages others to do the same.
	
	
4. During the semester how much have you discussed the course material outside of class?

    a. I have talked about it with my classmates when completing assignments.
	
    b. I have talked about it with my classmates when completing assignments and in other situations.
	
    c. I have talked about it with classmates and with faculty other than the course instructor.
	
    d. I have talked about it with friends and/or family in addition to classmates and/or faculty.


5. How would you describe your participation in the class Twitter discussions?

    a. I didn't participate in these discussions.

    b. I participated weekly but below the minimum required level (1 original post and 2 comments).

    c. I participated at the minimum required level (1 original post and 2 comments).

    d. I participated actively (above the minimum required level) and contributed thoughtful comments on the posts of my peers.

6. How would you rate the Twitter discussions used in this course?

    a. I feel that the Twitter discussions did not help me relate to the course material.

    b. I feel that the Twitter discussions were somewhat helpful but could have been better.

    c. I feel that the Twitter discussions helped me extend my knowledge of the course material.

    d. I feel that the Twitter discussions influenced my view of the world in an engineering context.
