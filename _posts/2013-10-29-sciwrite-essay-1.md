#Essay 1 completed for the SciWrite MOOC offered by Stanford University.

The teaching methodology referred to as "Active Learning" is used to encompass a broad range of techniques that require the student to be an active participant in the learning process. This definition contrasts what most people envision when they picture the university lecture hall (an instructor at the front of the room lecturing to a group of students who are passively observing). An instructor's approach to active learning can vary greatly by discipline, school, or individual but all methods require that students tackle "meaningful learning activities and think about what they are doing," (Prince, 2004). In his paper, Dr. Prince extensively reviews the published works studying the effectiveness of active learning for engineering education.

Dr. Prince's first major conclusion was that students retain more of the subject matter when activities are introduced into the course. This result appears in numerous studies even when reducing the total course material covered by the instructor. Therefore, the prevalent methodology of cramming as much content into a lecture period as possible actually reduces the volume of knowledge gained by the student. The students' ability to recall more content with the use of course activities is typically attributed to the students' need to use higher order thinking (associated with active learning).

Dr. Prince's second major conclusion addressed the use of collaborative learning, where students complete assignments or tasks in groups rather than individually. He found that this method promoted improved learning outcomes. While there is some evidence to suggest that individual accountability is still necessary, no evidence supports the use of inter-student competition as a motivation for better course performance.

In summary, Dr. Prince's review provides a valuable resource for instructors looking to improve their educational practices. While the evidence supporting active learning as a technique is nearly universally accepted, the application of active learning to the classroom can take many forms. Dr. Prince clearly distilled the relevant information found in the literature and summarized several best practices. Further, he described the learning outcomes associated with each methodology and offered an interpretation of the results.
