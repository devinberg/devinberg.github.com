### Prologue
I have adapted this guide from [Kevin Richardson's post](http://magically.us/2013-02-03/creating-a-pelican-powered-site-on-github-pages.html) on how to generate a Pelican-powered site that is hosted on Github. I have stripped most of the relevant info such that this post contains only the basic information required for my usage. For a more complete version please refer to the previous link.


### Assumptions
1. You're using a Unix-like environment (or have everything setup properly in Windows) and are comfortable using a command-line terminal and shell.
2. You have Python.
3. You have installed Git and have created a [GitHub](http://github.com) account. I furthermore assume you have working knowledge of Git. [GitHub's help pages](https://help.github.com/) may prove useful for many questions you may have.
4. Everything relating to Pelican is installed and configured according to [this post](http://magically.us/2013-02-03/creating-a-pelican-powered-site-on-github-pages.html).


### General Workflow
1. Create or edit your posts or pages using Markdown and your favorite editor.
2. Save your changed files to the appropriate locations. Folders dictate categories.
3. Add any newly created files to git using `gid add .`
4. Run `git commit -am "Message describing the post"`
5. Push the source changes with `git push origin source`
6. Push compiled files to your website with `make github`
