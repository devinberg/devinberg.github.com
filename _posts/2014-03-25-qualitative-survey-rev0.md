After my [first mentor meeting]({% post_url 2014-02-26-mentor-meeting-sotl %}) it was decided that my next step would be to draft a qualitative survey to use for this project. Originally the thought was to use a standard Likert scale survey. However, I have been reading "[How Learning Works: Seven Research-Based Principles for Smart Teaching](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0470484101/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0470484101&linkCode=as2&tag=madibiki-20)" (great book by the way) and there is a section discussing the use of self-assessment style surveys which help the survey taker accurately determine their understanding of a topic. Thus I decided to attempt this approach and write a self-assessment style survey. The drafted questions are included below.

###The Survey Draft
1. How would you rate your ability to identify engineering principles in your surroundings?

    a. I am not sure how the engineering principles discussed in this class relate to real life.

    b. I can understand the application of engineering to a real life example when shown an example.

    c. I can identify the engineering principles discussed in this class when I see them.

    d. I can apply engineering analysis to a situation that I observe.

2. How prepared are you to discuss engineering mechanics with others?

    a. I do not think that I could carry on a conversation about engineering mechanics with others.

    b. I could describe simple engineering mechanics ideas with someone but not in detail.

    c. I could discuss engineering mechanics in a thoughtful manner even on topics that are new to me.

    d. I actively seek out conversations about engineering mechanics with others.

3. How do you see yourself fitting within the greater engineering community?

    a. I am not sure how I fit into the greater engineering community.

    b. I see myself as an engineer who does their job and nothing more.

    c. I see myself as an engineer who actively promotes greater engineering knowledge in the world.

    d. I see myself as an engineer who does outreach in my community and encourages others to do the same.

4. How would you describe your participation in the class Twitter discussions?

    a. I didn't participate in these discussions.

    b. I participated occasionally but every week.

    c. I participated at the minimum required level.

    d. I participated actively and contributed thoughtful comments on the posts of my peers.

5. How would you rate the Twitter discussions used in this course?

    a. I feel that the Twitter discussions did not help me relate to the course material.

    b. I feel that the Twitter discussions were somewhat helpful but could have been better.

    c. I feel that the Twitter discussions helped me extend my knowledge of the course material.

    d. I feel that the Twitter discussions influenced my view of the world in an engineering context.
