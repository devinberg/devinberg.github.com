How can you improve ice traction for wheelchairs? Is this even needed?

#Needs
* light-weight
* deployable
* compatible with existing wheelchairs
* safe

#Existing devices
* [Chains](http://www.google.com/patents/US5261470): Basically wheel chains attached by straps.
    * Must be attached ahead of time.
	* Cannot be retracted when ice not present.
* [Front-wheel Skis](http://www.gizmag.com/wheelblades-mini-wheelchair-skis/24329/): I guess that's an option.
* [Zip-ties](http://www.usatechguide.org/blog/wheelchair-improve-traction/): Put a bunch of zip-ties on the wheels.
    * Not exactly user friendly.
	* Seen before for use on bike tires.
    * Don't last very long.
* [SAW Wheel](http://design.ema.wisc.edu/2010/index.html): Deployable attachment that provides traction.
    * Looks heavy.
	* Large. I wonder if it could be smaller.
	
I wonder if you could use a very large iris diaphram like mechanism to deploy small studded pieces to provide traction.
