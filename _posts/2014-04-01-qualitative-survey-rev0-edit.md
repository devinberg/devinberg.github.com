Had another meeting with my NTLC Teaching Champions program mentor. At the [last meeting]({% post_url 2014-02-26-mentor-meeting-sotl %}) it was decided that my next step would be to draft a qualitative survey. I [did that]({% post_url 2014-03-25-qualitative-survey-rev0 %}) and thus we used this meeting to review the survey and make some edits to make it better. The resulting marked up file is included below.

###The Survey Edit
