Fermin live in a small village 200 kilometers outside of the capital city of Nicaragua with his family.
He grew up in this village just as his father before him, and his grandfather before that.
He had watched it change over the years as he grew up, growing from a few small houses to a bustling, lively community through the years of plentiful rain that he enjoyed as a kid.
But in recent years the rains had become less frequent and life had become more challenging.
People within the village had started to leave, some heading to the capital city looking for work and others across the border to Costa Rica to work the coffee harvest.
Meanwhile, all of this was happening while Fermin was trying to start a family.
He had married a beautiful young woman named Petrona from the nearby village and they had just finished building their house last year.
Then, after the last rainy season, which had produced less actual rain than the village elders had seen in many years, Fermin's wife gave birth to a healthy little girl.

Now, as the streambed run dry, Fermin had to figure out how they would have enough food and money to get them through the next five months.
Fermin's wife desperately wanted to start trying to have another baby, she had always dreamed of having two little children running around the house.
It was will all of these things racing through his mind that Fermin had to make a choice.
He could answer his brother's urging to join him in Costa Rica for the coffee harvest.
The work was hard and the hours were long, but the plantations were always looking for more bodies and he knew he wouldn't be turned away.
He could make the choice that so many of his friends and family had before his, find a way to get into the United States.
From there, he could find work and send money back home to Petrona.
It would mean not seeing his wife or child but perhaps he could create a better life for them now and when conditional improved, he would return.

For Fermin, this was a difficult decision.
