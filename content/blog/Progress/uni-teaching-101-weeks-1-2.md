Summary: My notes and writings from the first couple of weeks in University Teaching 101.
Status: draft

I'm getting started on this course a little late due to some time constraints but I'm doing my best to get caught up.

#Notes
##Week 1 Videos
* The research from neuroscience can be a valuable resource to inform the scholarship of teaching and learning. However care must be taken in the translation of the neuroscience findings to educational practice. If the findings are not implemented in exactly the same way in which they were tested in the neuroscience study which produced the result, then the outcomes can be very different and no longer applicable.
* All implemented items need to have a feedback system in place. This helps the student understand their own progress and allows the instructor to assess the item being implemented. If the feedback is negative then need to evaluate if you are tracking the right things or if the implementation is flawed.
* Small groups in the classroom have been repeatedly shown to be effective enhancement to student learning. Group size and composition is important. Peer feedback can be just as important as instructor feedback to support student learning.
* Experiential learning/project-based learning has been shown to have benefits. Relevance $\rightarrow$ retention. Practice $\rightarrow$ integration of knowledge. Application $\rightarrow$ generalizability. Synthesis and integration $\rightarrow$ depth.
