Summary: Some additional thoughts on the needs for this device.


#Needs
* deployability: perform task while seated, not too much extension, mechanical advantage, lever/switch always on top
* robustness to handle contaminants (snow, rain, salt, dirt, etc.)
* mechanical rather than electrical ideally
* ease of operation essential
* small/hidden when not in use

Need to find a customer consultant to better inform usability and other customer requirements.
