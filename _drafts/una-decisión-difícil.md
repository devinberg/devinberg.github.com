*Fermin lived in a small village 200 kilometers outside of the capital city of Nicaragua with his family.*
Fermin vivio en un pueblo pequeno doscientos kilometros fuera de la ciudad principal de Nicaragua con su familia. 
*He grew up in this village just as his father before him, and his grandfather before that.*
El crecio en esto pueblo lo mismo de su papa y su abuelo.
*He had watched it change over the years as he grew up, growing from a few small houses to a bustling, lively community through the years of plentiful rain that he enjoyed as a kid.*
El abservaba el cambio con los anos, crecio de algunas casas a un bullicioso, animado comunidad con anos de lluvia abundante que le gusta cuando Fermin era un nino.
*But in recent years the rains had become less frequent and life had become more challenging.*
Sin embargo, en anos recientos la lluvia fue menos y la vida era deficil.
*People within the village had started to leave, some heading to the capital city looking for work and others across the border to *Costa Rica to work the coffee harvest.*
La gente de la comunidad comenzado a dejar, algunos fueron Ã  la ciudad principal por trabajar y otros a Costa Rica por la cosecha de cafe.
*Meanwhile, all of this was happening while Fermin was trying to start a family.*
Mientras tanto, Fermin estaba tratando de formar una familia.
*He had married a beautiful young woman named Petrona from the nearby village and they had just finished building their house last year.*
Se habia casado con una mujer joven y bella, se llama Petrona, de un pueblo cercano y ellos terminaron una casa en el ano pasado.
*Then, after the last rainy season, which had produced less actual rain than the village elders had seen in many years, Fermin's wife gave birth to a healthy little girl.*
Entonces, con la temporada lluviosa, con menos de lluvia que los ancianos pudieran recordar, Fermin y su esposa tenian una nina sana.

*Now, as the streambed run dry, Fermin had to figure out how they would have enough food and money to get them through the next five months.*
*Fermin's wife desperately wanted to start trying to have another baby, she had always dreamed of having two little children running around the house.*
*It was will all of these things racing through his mind that Fermin had to make a choice.*
*He could answer his brother's urging to join him in Costa Rica for the coffee harvest.*
*The work was hard and the hours were long, but the plantations were always looking for more bodies and he knew he wouldn't be turned away.*
*He could make the choice that so many of his friends and family had before his, find a way to get into the United States.*
*From there, he could find work and send money back home to Petrona.*
*It would mean not seeing his wife or child but perhaps he could create a better life for them now and when conditional improved, he would return.*

*For Fermin, this was a difficult decision."

*Ultimately, with lots of consideration and the urging of Petrona, Fermin decided to stay."
**He didn't want to miss the development of his daughter and, though he didn't say it, he wanted another child as well."
*With the help of his friends who had also decided to stay, Fermin formed a youth council with the mission of keeping the village alive and finding a way to make it prosperous again.*
*The group approaches this task with vigor and a willingness to seek outside help, something the elders had shunned in the past.*
*With renewed hope and optimism, the community has become a happy place to live again, full of music and dancing.*
