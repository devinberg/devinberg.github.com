Summary: My notes and writings from the first couple of weeks in University Teaching 101.
Status: draft

I'm getting started on this course a little late due to some time constraints but I'm doing my best to get caught up.

#Notes
##Week 1 Videos: The Science of Teaching and Learning
###Video 1: Teaching with the Science of Learning
* The data available to us can be used to inform educational practice. Don't ignore the data by sticking to the traditional lecture approach just because that is how it has always been done.
* Researchable questions, just like in normal scientific research.
* Data $\rightarrow$ analysis $\rightarrow$ interpretation.

###Video 2: Neuro-Education - The Role of Neuroscience in Teaching and Learning
* The research from neuroscience can be a valuable resource to inform the scholarship of teaching and learning. However care must be taken in the translation of the neuroscience findings to educational practice. If the findings are not implemented in exactly the same way in which they were tested in the neuroscience study which produced the result, then the outcomes can be very different and no longer applicable.
* All implemented items need to have a feedback system in place. This helps the student understand their own progress and allows the instructor to assess the item being implemented. If the feedback is negative then need to evaluate if you are tracking the right things or if the implementation is flawed.
* Small groups in the classroom have been repeatedly shown to be effective enhancement to student learning. Group size and composition is important. Peer feedback can be just as important as instructor feedback to support student learning.
* Experiential learning/project-based learning has been shown to have benefits. Relevance $\rightarrow$ retention. Practice $\rightarrow$ integration of knowledge. Application $\rightarrow$ generalizability. Synthesis and integration $\rightarrow$ depth.
* For project-based learning to be realized, classrooms need to remove barriers. Round tables for small groups and necessary resources available.
* Pacing and review: frequent review of material can help with retention.
* Find what works $\rightarrow$ implement $\rightarrow$ monitor outcomes $\rightarrow$ innovate $\rightarrow$ pilot study $\rightarrow$ monitor, scale.
* Just like in other fields, look to the literature, randomized trials are still the gold standard that you should look for.
* Don't necessarily assume that what works in a pilot study scales to a larger classroom setting. Dynamics change.

###Video 3: Understanding Learners and Responding to their Differences
* "Target knows more about me than my own mother."
* How can you create a personalized environment for the student? Rather than teaching to the middle.
* How do we pay attention to the high-performing students and the struggling students?
* We should be moving towards a model that is adaptive to the needs of every student in the classroom, helping them to maximize their personal learning.
* Learning styles are not fixed personality traits. The way students learn can be different for each possible context or environment. Can't assume that all students fit into any one mold.
* To get started with personalization: know as much as possible about each student, offer choice, formative assessment/feedback, enhanced with technology.

###Video 4: Technology and Support for Next Generation Learning
* LMS's are just generic tools for content delivery.
* Digital content is now so widely available that it is hard to ignore. However unvetted information is also very prevalent.
    * The consumer expectation is that this form of educational content is very low cost or free.
	* Educators are no longer the sole source of content. How did this change the role of the instructor in the educational process?
* The use of online examination allows for data capture. But how does this affect student performance? Digital exams not accessible to all students.
* Computer assisted instruction: competency-based progressions, data tracking, individualized support. Assessment, credentialing, accreditation.
    * Prevalent in statistics courses.
* **Social networking** / group communication permits regular communication with teachers / peers. Outside-of-class support groups.
* Technology does not solve all of our educational problems but can help us to understand them more deeply and work towards a solution more efficiently.

###Video 5: The Science of Learning at Work in Practice
* How do you match instructional techniques with the learning profiles of our students?
* Find evidence based approaches $\rightarrow$ employ $\rightarrow$ assess $\rightarrow$ iterate $\rightarrow$ innovate.
* Be prepared to abandon "innovative" approaches if they prove to be ineffective.
* Student performance needs to be assessed individually rather than using a class average. May not be feasible for students you only see in 1 course.

##Week 2 Videos: Principles of Best Practices in Education
###Video 1: 
* What is an example of a learning practice you have learned about recently and how does it relate to a principle of best practice?

###Video 2: Evidence-Based Teaching
* Evidence-based teaching is a natural progression of wanting to be a competent in educators.
* We can also help to improve the educational process by documenting what works well and what does not.
* Most instructors receive no formal training in how to be educators.
* 7 Principles of Best Practices in Education
    * Active Learning: Learners are doing something.
	* Prompt Feedback: Feedback to the learner.
	* High Expectations: Good outcomes are expected and communicated.
	* Collaboration: Learners learn from each other.
	* Time on Task: Time is used wisely to learn content and skills.
	* Diverse Ways of Learning: A variety of methods or techniques are offered to learn the material to meet diverse student needs.
	* Learner/Faculty Interaction: Interaction is important.
* These principles have been demonstrated over and over to be effective for a variety of programs and a diverse set of students.
* Learners tend to desire participatory learning experience because they tend to work.

###Video 3: Strategies and Approaches to Integrate Principles of Best Practices
* Active Learning
    * Students present work in class.
	* **Relate outside activities to subjects covered in course.**
	* Analysis case studies, videos, simulations, etc.
* Prompt Feedback
    * Provide frequent opportunities to perform and be assessed.
	* Help students to reflect on what they have learned.
	* Simply ask questions in class.
* High Expectations
    * Clearly communicate your expectations.
	* Keep those expectations high.
	* Use positive reinforcement.
	* Encourage students to work hard.
	* Challenge students.
	* Encourage students not to focus on grades but on the learning.
* Collaboration
    * Team effort leads to greater learning.
	* Improves thinging and deeper understanding.
	* **Activities** done in groups.
* Time on Task
    * Time plus energy equals learning.
	* Teach students effective time management.
	* Provide benchmarks to build towards a final product.
	* Communicate expectations of student time and effort outside of class.
	* Model time management by returning graded items quickly.
* Diverse Ways of Learning
    * People bring different talents and backgrounds to the classroom. Need opportunity to demonstrate acquired skills in a variety of ways.
	* Provide problems that can be solved in a variety of ways.
	* Allow choice in the completion of project requirements.
	* Diverse methods of content delivery: hands-on, lecture, written, visual.
	* Incorporate technological resources.
* Learner/Faculty Interaction
    * Faculty concern can help students through a rough time and help them to keep on track.
	* Knowing faculty can improve intellectual commitment.
	* Arrive early and stay late.
	* Know students by name.
	* Encourage students to come to office hours.
	* Seek out students who are struggling or missing class.
	
###Video 4: Application of Principles of Best Practices in Developing Your Course
* Considerations for course developement
    * Where are we going?
	* How are we going to get there? Resources?
	* How will we know that we have done it? Evaluation?
* Identify your students.
    * Pre-assessments can help here.
* What are the purposes/objectives?
    * Objectives should be written in measurable terms.
	* Bloom's taxonomy.
	* Specific enough to measure.
	* Action oriented.
* Identify the course organization: content, design, activities, etc.
    * Organized into "must-know" or "nice-to-know" type content.
	* Is the content too much or not enough?
	* Help students to be resourceful information seekers.
	* Consistency and organization to make the course easy to navigate.
* Apply the principles of best practices.
    * How can the principles be brought into the course?
	
###Video 5: Principles of Best Practice in Action
* Introduce yourself to students in advance of the course using a video that covers you, your research, basics of the course, logistics, commonly asked questions, etc.
* Ask students to prepare for class by requiring things to be done in advance of lecture so they are ready to learn that day's material.
